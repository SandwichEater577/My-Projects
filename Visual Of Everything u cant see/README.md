# Visual Of Everything You Can't See

An educational visualization project dedicated to making abstract computing concepts tangible.

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to peel back the layers of technology and provide a visual understanding of how software and hardware actually interact. It focuses on the "hidden" logic that happens inside your processor and within complex algorithms.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### [Algorithms/](Algorithms/)

Interactive visualizations of fundamental computer science algorithms:

- **Sorting:** Visualize Bubble, Quick, and Merge sorts.
- **Searching:** Step through Binary vs Linear searches.
- **Pathfinding:** Watch A\* and Dijkstra find the shortest route.

### [How your Computer Calculates/](How%20your%20Computer%20Calculates/)

Low-level logic visualizations:

- **Binary Logic:** Visualizing 0s and 1s moving through logic gates.
- **ALU Operations:** How addition and subtraction happen at the transistor level.
- **Memory Addressing:** Seeing how data is retrieved from RAM.

## 🔬 Goals

- Make learning Computer Science more intuitive.
- Provide a clear bridge between high-level code and low-level hardware.
- Create a playground for experimenting with logic gates and algorithm efficiency.
